        <h2> Stocks retreat, oil prices up </h2>
        <h3> Apr 06, 2022</h3>
        <p> LONDON â€” Global equities sank on Wednesday on bets the Federal Reserve will act more aggressively to bring inflation under control, while oil prices rebounded.
            Asian and European bourses retreated after heavy falls on Wall Street on Tuesday.
            The euro hit a one-month dollar low before minutes from the Fed's latest policy meeting was due to start on Wednesday.
            London stocks slid also as UK businesses and individuals saw a major tax hike kick in, worsening Britain's cost-of-living crisis as domestic energy bills rocket.  
            Minutes from the Fed's March meeting will be pored over for insights into the thinking of US central bankers, in light of the Ukraine war and recent data suggesting the world's top economy remains resilient.
