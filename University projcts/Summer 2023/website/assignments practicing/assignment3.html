        <h2> The Alchemist </h2>
        <p > The Alchemist by Paulo Coelho continues to change the lives of its readers forever.
            With more than two million copies sold around the world, 
            The Alchemist has established itself as a modern classic, universally admired.
            Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the magical story of Santiago, an Andalusian
             shepherd boy who yearns to travel in search of a worldly treasure as extravagant as 
             any ever found. 
            The story of the treasures Santiago finds along the way teaches us, as only a few stories can, about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts, learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, above all, following our dreams.
